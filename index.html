<h2>Chakras in Avatar: The Last Airbender</h2>
<p>Open the 7 chakras with the guidance of Guru Pathik.</p>
<p>Aang. Gain control of [my energy]. How?</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. You must gain balance within yourself.</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. In order to master [your energy] you must open all the chakras.</p>
<p>Aang. What are chakras?</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. ðŸ˜‘â€¦ the basicsâ€¦ energy flows through your bodyâ€¦ there are several pools where the [energy] swirls around before flowing on.</p>
<p>Aang. <strong>So, Chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies.</strong></p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Exactly. If nothing else were around this [energy] would flow pure and clear; however, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the [pools], and then what happens?</p>
<p>Aang. The [energy] can&#39;t flow?</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Yes, but if we open the paths between the pools.</p>
<p>Aang. The energy flows.</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. There are 7 Chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Be warned opening the chakras is an intense experience and once you begin this process you cannot stop until all 7 are open. Are you ready?</p>
<p>Earth Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and it&#39;s blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to youâ€¦ You must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek.</p>
<p>Water Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. This chakra deals with pleasure, and it&#39;s blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt which burdens your soul. What do you blame yourself for?... Accept the reality that these things happen but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world you need to forgive yourself.</p>
<p>Fire Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Located in the stomach. This chakra deals with willpower, and it&#39;s blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?... You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life.</p>
<p>Heart Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. It Deals with love, and it&#39;s blocked by grief. Lay all your grief out in front of you. You have indeed felt a great loss, but love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around usâ€¦ [love] has not leftâ€¦ it is still inside your heart and is reborn in the form of new love. Let the pain flow away.</p>
<p>Sound/Truth Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Located in the throat. It Deals with truth, and it&#39;s blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves. You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept [who you are].</p>
<p>Light Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight, and it&#39;s blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same.</p>
<p>Aang. Like the [Countries].</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided.</p>
<p>Aang. We are all connected, everything is connected.</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. That&#39;s right. Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. (Mystical music begins) If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one; four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of the earth that has been purified and refined.</p>
<p>Toph. (Bends metal for the 1st time).</p>
<p>Thought Chakra:</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. Located at the crown of your head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and it&#39;s blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. Now let all of those attachments go, let them flow down the river, forgotten. Learn to let [them] go or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universeâ€¦ Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.</p>
<p>Guru Pathik. by choosing attachment you have locked the chakra.</p>
